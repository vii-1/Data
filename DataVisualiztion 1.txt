//////
The histogram shows the distribution of ticket prices paid by passengers aboard the Titanic. Most fares were concentrated at lower values, with a long tail of higher fares. This suggests a diverse range of passengers with varying economic means, with the majority paying lower fares.

Conclusion

Passenger Class Distribution: Most people were in the cheapest class, and fewer were in the more expensive ones.

Passenger Class Distribution by Gender: There were more men than women, especially in the cheapest class.

Distribution of Ticket Prices: Most tickets were cheap, but some were really expensive, showing that people with different amounts of money were on the ship.
